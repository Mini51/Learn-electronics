# Resistor Circuits

## What are we learning in this section? 
In this section we will be learning about diffrent types of circuits that use resistors. 

## What are resistor circuits? 
Resistor circuits are circuits that use resistors mainly.

## What are the different types of resistor circuits?
There are many different types of resistor circuits, but we will be learning about the basic ones. including:
- [Series Resistors](Series-resistors.md) / Done
- [Parallel Resistors](Parallel-resistors.md)
