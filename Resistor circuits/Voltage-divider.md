# Voltage divider

A voltage divider is a circuit that takes a voltage and splits it into two different voltages. The voltage divider is made up of two resistors and a power source. The voltage divider is used to reduce the voltage of a power source. The voltage divider is also used to split the voltage of a power source into two different voltages. 

## Example:

In this example we have a 9v power source and two resistors. The 2 resistors are 100Ω and 200Ω. The voltage divider is used to split the 9v power source into two different voltages. The voltage divider is also used to reduce the voltage of the power source.

The output voltage of the circuit above is 6v

## How do we calculate the voltage divider? 

The formula for calculating the output voltage is shown below: 

`Vout = Vin ∗ R2 / R1 + R2`

Where:

`Vout` is the output voltage
`Vin` is the input voltage
`R1` is the resistance of the first resistor
`R2` is the resistance of the second resistor

## Try it yourself

Try to calculate the output voltage of the circuit below:

In this circuit the input voltage is 12v and resistor 1 is 30Ω and resistor 2 is 50Ω. 

The output voltage is:

<summary>Answer: What is the output voltage</summary>

`Vout = 12v ∗ 50Ω / 30Ω + 50Ω = 7.5v`

The answer is 7.5v
