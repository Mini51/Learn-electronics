# Current



## What is current 
Current is the flow of electrical charge. Eletrical charges are made up of Positve and Negative charges. When one charge is Positive and the other is Negative, they attract each other. When they are both Positive or both Negative, they repel each other.

Since copper has one extra electron, it is negatively charged. When the copper is connected to a positive charge, the electrons will flow to the positive charge. This is will cause electricity to flow through the coppper. This is why copper is used in wires.


## How is current measured
Current is measured in Amperes (A). The symbol for amperes is A. Amperes is the amount of charge that flows through a circuit in one second. The equation for current is I.
