# Introduction 
In this repo we will be learning the basics of electrical engineering and electronics, starting from the very basics and working our way up to more advanced topics.


## What is electrical engineering?
"Electrical engineers design, develop, test, and supervise the manufacture of electrical equipment."

## What is electronics? 
"Electronics is the science of controlling electrical energy electrically, in contrast to electrical engineering, which uses electricity to perform energy conversion or work."
