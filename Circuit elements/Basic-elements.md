A resitor is a device that resists the flow of electrons. The resistance of a resistor is measured in ohms. The resistance of a resistor is constant. The resistance of a resistor is measured by the voltage across the resistor and the current through the resistor. The equation for resistance is: `V = I * R` (Ohm's law)

A capacitor is a device that stores energy in the form of electric charge. The capacitance of a capacitor is measured in farads. The capacitance of a capacitor is constant. The capacitance of a capacitor is measured by the voltage across the capacitor and the current through the capacitor. The equation for capacitance is: `I = C * dV/dt`

A inductor is a device that stores energy in the form of magnetic field. The inductance of a inductor is measured in henrys. The inductance of a inductor is constant. The inductance of a inductor is measured by the voltage across the inductor and the current through the inductor.  The equation for inductance is: `V = L * dI/dt`
