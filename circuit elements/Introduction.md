# Circuit elements

## What are we learning in this section? 
In this section we will be learning about the basic circuit elements, such as resistors, capacitors, inductors. 

## What are circuit elements? 
Circuit elements are the basic building blocks of a circuit. They are the components that we use to build circuits. 

## What are the different types of circuit elements?
There are many different types of circuit elements, but we will be learning about the basic ones. including:
- [Resistors](/circuit%20elements/specific/Resistors.md)
- [Capacitors](/circuit%20elements/specific/Capacitors.md)
- [Inductors](/circuit%20elements/specific/Inductors.md)
