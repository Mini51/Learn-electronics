This can either come from a Power Supply or a Battery. It is a constant voltage source. It is ideal because it has no internal resistance. If you are using a battery, use the battery symbol. If you are using a power supply, use the power supply symbol. 

Polarity for a battery is the longer line is positive and the shorter line is negative.


## Ideal Current Source

The polarity for an ideal current source is the the direction of the arrow is the direction of the current.

##  Plot on a IV graph
To plot this both the voltage and the current on a IV graph you will put the voltage on the x-axis and the current on the y-axis. the formula for the Voltage is ` V = V` and the formula for the current is `I = I`.
