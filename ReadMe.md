# Learn Electronics

## Warning 
I am not a professional electrician, I am just a student who is learning about electronics.
When working with electricity be very careful, I am not responsible for any damage you may cause to yourself or others. 


## About
In this github repository, you will find a collection of markdown files that can be used to learn electrical engineering and how to make circuits. We will be starting from the very basics and working our way up to more advanced topics.
